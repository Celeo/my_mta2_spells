## Mage Sight

### Peripheral

Always active. The mage sees the world through the lens of their Path. Reveals active supernatural effects not intended to be hidden.

### Active

Requires activation as a reflexive action. Automatically uses the mage's two path ruling arcana and costs 1 mana to include a common or inferior arcanum for a scene. Reveals all active supernatural effects within the mage's normal senses, as well as spells as they are being cast. Casting shows the mage's Nimbus and the formed Imago. Some targets can still be hidden from the mage with concealment magic, which causes a Clash of Wills. Causes a -2 modifier to all actions when active to rolls not related to magic. Can only be active for a number of minus equal to Gnosis per scene, after which a point of Willpower can be used to keep it up for the rest of the scene.

### Focused

Requires all of the mage's attention as they focus on a single thing. Anything with the ability to see magic knows that the mage is using this sight. Comes in 2 stages: Scrutiny and Revelation. Revelation is a quick glance that gives some information, resisted by the Opacity. Scrutiny is the process of picking apart the Opacity to gain all knowledge about the target, and is dangerous and time-consuming.

**Revelation** is an instant action that can be taken at any time. Roll `Gnosis + Arcanum - Opacity`.

|Roll result|Effect|
|-|-|
|Dramatic Failure|No mage can investigate the target for 24 hours without using the Prime spell Cleanse Pattern.|
|Failure|The mage is unable to reveal anything about the subject, but can still Scrutinize.|
|Success|The mage discovers the surface information.|
|Exceptional Success|The mage discovers the surface information and can either lower the Opacity by 1 or uncover 1 piece of deep information.|

**Scrutiny** requires spending a point of Willpower. While Scrutinizing, all non-magic rolls are made at -3. Clash of Wills may apply if the target is being magically concealed. Scrutiny is an extended action where the mage rolls Gnosis + Arcanum once per turn. Every time that the mage gets a number of successes equal to or higher than the Opacity over any number of rounds, the Opacity is reduced by 1. After a number of rolls equal to Gnosis + Arcanum, the mage's magic starts to leak into the mystery, which means that every time the mage fails a Scrutiny roll after this point, add half the mage's Gnosis, rounded up, to the Opacity, which applies to all mages investigating the mystery in the future. The mage can spend mana during this Scrutiny process to add 1 success to that turn's roll as long as it already succeeded, up to a number of times equal to the limit of the mage's Gnosis.

|Roll result|Effect|
|-|-|
|Dramatic Failure|Opacity increases by 2. If the mage has already made a number of rolls equal to Gnosis + Arcanum, a Supernal entity of the mage's Path notices the mage|
|Failure|Nothing happens with Opacity. If the mage has already made a number of rolls equal to Gnosis + Arcanum, Opacity increases by Gnosis / 2 (round up)|
|Success|Mage can choose to spend 1 mana to increase successes by 1. If the rolling number of successes equals the Opacity, the Opacity is reduced by 1 and successes reset to 0. The mage can choose to stop Scrutinizing the mystery and pick up where they left off at a later time.|
|Exceptional Success|Apply the effect of a normal Success. Additionally, the mage may do one of the following instead of the normal Exceptional Success effects: apply all successes accrued even if it lowers the Opacity by more than one, or spend a point of mana to add Gnosis to Opacity for other mages, or spend a point of mana to remove their Nimbus from the area.|
