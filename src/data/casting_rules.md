* Channel Mana spell with Prime 3
* Consuming tass from a Hallow
* Fulfilling an Obsession
* Scour patern - reduce a physical attribute by 1 for 24 hours or take 1 resistant lethal wound to restore 3 mana, a number of times per day based on Gnosis

## Mage Sight

### Peripheral

Always active. The mage sees the world through the lens of their Path. Reveals active supernatural effects not intended to be hidden.

### Active

Requires activation as a reflexive action. Automatically uses the mage's two path ruling arcana and costs 1 mana to include a common or inferior arcanum for a scene. Reveals all active supernatural effects within the mage's normal senses, as well as spells as they are being cast. Casting shows the mage's Nimbus and the formed Imago. Some targets can still be hidden from the mage with concealment magic, which causes a Clash of Wills. Causes a -2 modifier to all actions when active to rolls not related to magic. Can only be active for a number of minus equal to Gnosis per scene, after which a point of Willpower can be used to keep it up for the rest of the scene.

|Arcanum|Additional Mage Sight Effect|
|-|-|
|Death|Detect Anchors and manifested ghosts and related phenomena. Can tell if someone has a soul or is dead.|
|Fate|Detect dramatic failures and exceptional successes; reveals the presence and use of Destiny but not the details.|
|Forces|Detect motion and enviromental Tilts, fire, electricity, etc.; can tell if a device is powered.|
|Life|Detect life, reveal if a body is alive, reveal level of injury; show toxins, diseases, personal tilts.|
|Matter|Detect Structure & Durability, highlight value/quality of items.|
|Mind|Detect presence of thinking beings, as well as if someone is asleep, comatose, awake, meditating, or projecting, as well as the use of Willpower.|
|Prime|Detect possible Yantras, Awakenined spells, Attainment effects, hallows, and nodes.|
|Space|Determine distance, range, and cover, as well as spatial warps, scrying windows, and Irises.|
|Spirit|Determine strength of the Gauntlet, presence & nature of Resonance Condition & other Essence, and detects manifested spirits & related.|
|Time|Detect initiative ratings, when someone is about to take an action, detect temporal warps and time travelers.|

### Focused

Requires all of the mage's attention as they focus on a single thing. Anything with the ability to see magic knows that the mage is using this sight. Comes in 2 stages: Scrutiny and Revelation. Revelation is a quick glance that gives some information, resisted by the Opacity. Scrutiny is the process of picking apart the Opacity to gain all knowledge about the target, and is dangerous and time-consuming.

**Revelation** is an instant action that can be taken at any time. Roll `Gnosis + Arcanum - Opacity`.

|Roll result|Effect|
|-|-|
|Dramatic Failure|No mage can investigate the target for 24 hours without using the Prime spell Cleanse Pattern.|
|Failure|The mage is unable to reveal anything about the subject, but can still Scrutinize.|
|Success|The mage discovers the surface information.|
|Exceptional Success|The mage discovers the surface information and can either lower the Opacity by 1 or uncover 1 piece of deep information.|

**Scrutiny** requires spending a point of Willpower. While Scrutinizing, all non-magic rolls are made at -3. Clash of Wills may apply if the target is being magically concealed. Scrutiny is an extended action where the mage rolls Gnosis + Arcanum once per turn. Every time that the mage gets a number of successes equal to or higher than the Opacity over any number of rounds, the Opacity is reduced by 1. After a number of rolls equal to Gnosis + Arcanum, the mage's magic starts to leak into the mystery, which means that every time the mage fails a Scrutiny roll after this point, add half the mage's Gnosis, rounded up, to the Opacity, which applies to all mages investigating the mystery in the future. The mage can spend mana during this Scrutiny process to add 1 success to that turn's roll as long as it already succeeded, up to a number of times equal to the limit of the mage's Gnosis.

|Roll result|Effect|
|-|-|
|Dramatic Failure|Opacity increases by 2. If the mage has already made a number of rolls equal to Gnosis + Arcanum, a Supernal entity of the mage's Path notices the mage|
|Failure|Nothing happens with Opacity. If the mage has already made a number of rolls equal to Gnosis + Arcanum, Opacity increases by Gnosis / 2 (round up)|
|Success|Mage can choose to spend 1 mana to increase successes by 1. If the rolling number of successes equals the Opacity, the Opacity is reduced by 1 and successes reset to 0. The mage can choose to stop Scrutinizing the mystery and pick up where they left off at a later time.|
|Exceptional Success|Apply the effect of a normal Success. Additionally, the mage may do one of the following instead of the normal Exceptional Success effects: apply all successes accrued even if it lowers the Opacity by more than one, or spend a point of mana to add Gnosis to Opacity for other mages, or spend a point of mana to remove their Nimbus from the area.|

## Paradox

Adding paradox to a roll:

|Mod|Cause|
|-|-|
|+X|Additional reaches (total count is determined by Gnosis)|
|+2|Inured|
|+1|Stacking paradox in the scene|
|+1|Sleepers witness an obvious casting of magic|
|-2|Mage uses a dedicated magical tool as a Yantra|
|-X|Mage spends X points of Mana to lower Paradox|

Multiple Sleeper witnesses add the following effects:

|Count|Effect|
|-|-|
|A few|9-Again|
|Large group|8-Again|
|Crowd|Rote quality|

### Releasing Paradox

The Storyteller rolls the Paradox pool.

|Roll result|Effect|
|-|-|
|Dramatic Failure|Mage does not invoke Paradox, regains a point of Willpower, and the next Paradox roll for them in the same scene does not have the +1 stacking count|
|Failure|No paradox|
|Success|Paradox occurs|
|Exceptional Success|Mage gains a Paradox Condition and a Paradox occurs|

If the result determines that a Paradox occurs, the spell is tained by the Abyss. The mage's pool to cast the spell is reduced by the number of hits on the Paradox roll. Whether or not the spell is cast successfully,
the Storyteller applies a Paradox Anomaly to the spell. The Storyteller gets a number of Reaches equal to the Paradox roll successes that they can spend.

|Cost|Effect|
|-|-|
|1|Undo or apply a single Reach (except casting time)|
|1|Impose a Condition on the subject of the spell|
|2|Change the target of the spell|
|3|Create an Abyssal Environmental Tilt|
|5|Summon an Abyssal entitiy, rank (reach - 5)|

The anomaly's duration depends on the caster's Wisdom.

|Wisdom|Paradox|
|-|-|
|Enlightened|One Scene|
|Understanding|One Chapter/day|
|Falling|One Story/month|
|Mad One|One Chronicle|year|

### Containing Paradox

The Storyteller rolls the Paradox pool.

The mage rolls their Wisdom dots (cannot be modified by anything). Each success cancels 1 of the Storyteller's successes and deals 1 resistant bashing wound to the mage. The spell is
not penalized and does not create an anomaly. If the Paradox roll still has successes, it causes a Paradox Condition based on the number of remaining hits.

#### Paradox Conditions

Causes:

* Dramatic Failure when casting a spell after incurring Paradox
* Exceptional Success on a released Paradox roll
* Failing to contain a Paradox

The mage can either accept the negative consequences of the Paradox condition, or allow it to lapse (length determined by Wisdom). The mage cannot use magic to mitigate the effects until taking one of those actions.

|Wisdom|Paradox|
|-|-|
|Enlightened|One Story/month|
|Understanding|One Chapter/day|
|Falling|One Scene|
|Mad One|One Turn|

If the condition is left to lapse, the Abyss corrupts the mage's pattern, and appears in their Nimbus, adding Paradox to each spellcasting attempt. The mage must scour their pattern to remove it.

Example Conditions:

|Name|Description|Resolutin|
|-|-|-|
|Abyssal Nimbus|The mage and all subjects affected by their Nimbus gain the Resonant condition for Abyssal entities (an exception success on the Paradox roll changes this to Open instead). The mage's Nimbus is heavily corrupted.|An Abyssal entitiy uses the condition to manifest|
|Abyssal Imago|Mage must spend additional reach equal to Paradox hits.|Successfully casts a spell that does not risk Paradox|
|Abyssal Backlash|Mage draws attention of an Annunaki. Next time mage casts a spell that risks Paradox, add Paradox equal to the remaining Paradox hits|Fully contains Paradox from a spell|
