## Fate

### Hexes

A **Hex** is one of the following effects:

* Impose a dice penalty of `Potency` to the next `Potency` mundane actions taken by the target until `Duration` expires.
* Impose a number of the following Tilts equal to `Potency` for `Duration` or until individually resolved: Arm Wrack, Blinded, Deafened, Insane, Knocked Down, Leg Wrack, Poisoned, or Sick. Additionally, the mage can use the custom Tilt construction rules to create a new tilt.

The mage may mix and match the above effects. For example, a Potency 4 hex could be used to apply a 4 dice penalty to the target's next 2 actions, and also apply the Blinded and Leg Wrack conditions for the Duration. Duplicate penalities and Tilts from hexes aren't added togther - only the strongest takes effect. Tilts that effect one of two body parts, like Arm Wrack or Blinded, can by applied twice to affect both of the pair in the target.

### Boons

A **Boon** is one of the following effects:

* Grant 9-again to a number of mundane rolls of `Potency` for `Duration`. If used on a chance roll, the chance die is tranformed to a single normal die. Adding a reach makes this effect grant 8-again. Adding 2 reach allows this effect to apply to spellcasting roles and powers.
* Grant a dice bonus of `Potency` to `Potency` mundane actions taken by the target until `Duration` expires; the target selects which rolls, before rolling, they wish to apply the effect to.
* Grant a number of the following beneficial conditions equal to `Potency` for `Duration` or until individually resolved: Charmed, Informed, Inspired, or Steadfast. None of these conditions grant Beats when they are resolved unless the caster achieved an exception success in the casting.

Like Hexes, Boons can be mixed and matched by the caster. No two effects can apply to the same skill. No character may have 2 of the same condition unless they target specific and different things.

Positive Conditions:

|Name|Effect|
|-|-|
|Charmed|Resolve to reduce a single bout of damage to 1, or let lapse and have the Storyteller provide a random benefit|
|Informed|Resolve before rolling on the subject that granted it - a failed roll succeeds with 1 success instead or a successful roll grants an Exceptiona Success instead|
|Inspired|Resolve before rolling - 3 successes are an Exceptional Success and restores a point of Willpower|
|Steadfast|Resolve after failing a roll to instead succeed with a single success, or resolve before rolling to change a chance die to a single normal die|

## Time

### Temporal Sympathy

|Sympathy|Description|Connection Withstand|Sympathy Withstand|
|-|-|-|-|
|Unchanged|Not changed in the time between then and now. Connection cannot be broken without Unmaking magic. Casting using the sympathy is not withstood.|5*|0|
|Strong|Not significantly changed: a person several days late, an injury hours later, street after hours of traffic, building after several days of habitation, or a gun that was fired.|3|1|
|Medium|Significantly changed: broken item, street after several businesses changed, building under new ownership.|2|2|
|Weak|Vastly different: mage before Awakening, item before being imbued, different building on the same lot, a building in ruin.|1|3|

\* can only be removed with Unmaking (Time 5) spells.

The more the target has changed over time, the harder it is to look back at it, but the easier it is to change. Magic that affects the future has no temporal sympathy.

### Other notes

* Time Traveling is visibile to those using Active Mage Sight with Time, and everything altered by the traveler shines with a temporal aura.
* If a character undoes time with magic, they and all other characters do not lose Beats they gained during the undone time. If they gain more Beats, those stay as well.
* When a Time Traveler returns to the present, changes they made are set and become Lasting and the temporal aura of change vanishes.
